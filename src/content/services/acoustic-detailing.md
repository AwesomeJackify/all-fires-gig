When it comes to building compliance, fire safety and acoustic performance often go hand in hand. Service penetrations, ceilings, and wall junctions that need fire stopping also affect how sound travels between rooms.

At **All Fire**, we specialise in fire proofing and provide integrated acoustic detailing as part of our service.

That means:

- One expert team handling both fire and acoustic requirements.
- Fully tested systems that meet NZ Building Code standards for fire resistance and sound reduction.
- Less coordination between trades, fewer site clashes, and faster project delivery.

## Why Choose Us?

- **Efficiency** — one contractor for two compliance-critical services.
- **Consistency** — seamless workmanship with no gaps between fire and acoustic treatments.
- **Value** — save on time, cost, and administration with a single point of accountability.

With All Fire, you don’t just get fire protection — you get the assurance that your building is both safer and quieter, delivered by one trusted specialist.
