Navigating fire safety and compliance in construction can be complex. At **All Fire**, our specialist consultancy services are designed to give you clarity, confidence, and a clear path to compliance â€” from design stage through to project completion.

## What We Offer

- **Pre-construction planning**  
  We work with architects, engineers, and contractors early to review plans, identify potential compliance issues, and recommend cost-effective passive fire solutions. This prevents delays and costly remedial work later.

- **Specification and product guidance**  
  With access to trusted systems (Hilti, Ryanfire, Allproof, GIB), we help you select the right products and systems for your project, ensuring compliance with AS 1530.4, AS 4072.1, and NZ Building Code.

- **On-site consultancy**  
  During installation, our consultants provide inspections, practical advice, and technical support to ensure correct detailing and application.

- **QA audits & documentation support**  
  We review installations and provide detailed reports, photos, and compliance records for BWOF, council sign-off, and insurance.

- **Remediation advice**  
  For existing buildings with non-compliant or outdated fire systems, we offer expert remediation planning and upgrade pathways to bring your building up to code without unnecessary cost or disruption.
