Every pipe, cable, duct, or service that passes through a fire-rated wall, floor, or ceiling creates a penetration — and if left unprotected, it becomes a weak point for fire and smoke to spread.

At **All Fire**, we specialise in fire stopping penetrations, ensuring your building remains fully compliant and protected.

## What We Do

- Quality assurance with before-and-after photos and compliance documentation for council sign-off and BWOF.

## Why It Matters
